# Greek New Testament Questions

A set of questions based on the SBLGNT text from [gnt-texts](https://github.com/jtauber/gnt-texts). Generated using the question and answer generator found [here](https://github.com/fhardison/af-question-answer-parser).

Also includes simple conversations in Ancient/Koine Greek.

Also includes some Indonesian versions. I learned some Indonesian and I have some friends who might enjoy learning Greek through Indonesian. Or one could learn Indonesian through Greek ;-).
